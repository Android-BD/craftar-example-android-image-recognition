## Catchoom CraftAR - Android Image Recognition SDK examples

### Introduction

Catchoom allows to create recognition experiences using the Catchoom CraftAR Service and the Image Recognition SDK ('Mobile SDK').

With Catchoom, you can create amazing apps that provide digital content
for real-life objects like printed media, packaging among others. You
